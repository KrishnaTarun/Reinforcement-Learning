# Reinforcement-Learning

This repository contains lab and homework assignment for the course Reinforcement Learning offered in M.Sc Artificial Intelligence at the University of Amsterdam.

## Labs

### Lab1
In this lab we get familiar with basic concepts of **Dynammic Programming** and use it for the implementation of **Policy Evaluation**, **Policy Iteration**  and **Value Iteration** for GridWorldEnv. We also implement **Monte Carlo Prediction** and **Monte Carlo control with $\epsilon$ - greedy policy** on  BlackjackEnv. Apart from that we also explore **Temporal Difference Learning**.
